    - Create a project folder,
    - Set up a virtual environment with `venv`,
    - Activate the virtual environment,
    - Pip install the required libraries,
    - Set up environment variables and explain "Replace the placeholders with the actual values".
- Add a main code components section. For each component:
  - Provide a brief one paragraph explanation of the code,
  - Show the relevant code in fenced code blocks.
  - Python libraries imports should **ALWAYS** be ordered and grouped using PEP 8 conventions.
    - No need to explain using PEP 8 conventions.
- Show the "Complete code" example and add a brief explanation.
  - Instruct the user to save the code example with the name `example.py`.
- How to run the example code
- End with a "Next steps" section and include related resources.

## Style and Language

- List all required Python libraries, including their specific versions.
- Ensure only required libraries are installed.
- Ensure the Authentication section matches the authentication type for the generated sample.

# Reasoning Steps

- Ensure the code is complete and functional.
- Ensure required libraries are installed.
- Ensure required environment variables are set in the docs and code.

# Output Format

- Format using GitHub flavored Markdown and always adhere to conventions.
- Ensure markdown headings levels are used consistently across the document
- Use **bold** for UI elements and button names.
- Use *italics* for placeholders.
- Use `code` formatting for commands, file names, and references.

  - Always indent the content for the tabs.
  - Use the following tab names:
    - === "Windows (PowerShell)"
    - === "Linux/macOS"
- The complete code example should include docstrings for the module, functions and classes.
- Python libraries imports should **ALWAYS** be ordered and grouped using PEP 8 conventions.
- Python library groups should be separated by a blank line.
